You can define your build and deployment scripts in C# using an intuitive fluent interface. This gives you code completion, IntelliSense, debugging, FlubuCore custom analyzers, and native access to the whole .NET ecosystem inside of your scripts. FlubuCore offers a .net (core) console application that uses power of roslyn to compile and execute scripts. Above example can be run from console with: FlubuCore runner flubu.exe Default FlubuCore dotnet cli tool dotnet flubu Default FlubuCore local or global tool flubu Default Features and Advantages \u00b6 Intuitive an easy to learn.

Getting Started \u00b6 Using FlubuCore is straightforward and very simple :-) It is also fully and throughly documented. The Getting Started chapter in Documentation will help you set up your first FlubuCore build in no time. You should also check getting started blog. It has some more details with some nice tips and tricks. A comprehensive list of features that FlubuCore has to offer with descriptions can be found in the Build Script Fundamentals chapter. Once you have your build and deployment scripts defined, the following Wiki chapters will explain how to run them: For .NET Framework projects use FlubuCore.Runner For .NET Core projects use FlubuCore CLI global tool Examples \u00b6 Aside from the detailed Wiki FlubuCore comes with example projects that reflect real-life situations. The examples can be found in the separate Examples repository . These examples will help you to get quickly start with FlubuCore: * .NET Framework build example - Example covers versioning, building the project, running tests, packaging application for deployment. .NET Core build example - Example covers versioning, building the project, running tests, packaging application for deployment. Deployment script example - Example shows how to write simple deployment script. Open source library example - Example covers versioning, building the project, running tests and publishing nuget package. It also covers how to run build script on Appveyor and Travis CI. Have a question? \u00b6 Contributing \u00b6 Please see CONTRIBUTING.md . Ways to Contribute \u00b6 Spread the word about the project. If you like the project don't forget to give it a star so that the community get's bigger. Improve documentation. Report, fix a bug. Implement a new feature. Discuss potential ways to improve project. Improve existing implementation, performance, etc. Further Development \u00b6 If you find FlubuCore useful (you feel it helps you on the daily basis) you can support further development by buying us a coffee (or become a backer or sponsor). Sometimes it's hard to stay awake till midnight implementing new features, coffee helps us with that. We would really appreciate your support. Money from sponsorship will also be used for the promotion of the project. If you are a backer or a sponsor you can also request for a new feature or ask for support. These issues will be handled with highest priority. Backers and Sponsors \u00b6 Changelog and Roadmap \u00b6 Changes with description and examples can be found in Changelog.

Empty build script example public class BuildScript : DefaultBuildScript { protected override void ConfigureTargets ( ITaskContext session ) { } } Targets \u00b6 Targets are used to perform specific work in a specific order. A target can for example execute flubu built in tasks like a task for compiling the solution or it can execute some custom csharp code. Target can also have dependencies on other targets. Create a new Target \u00b6 Following code will create a new target that will execute a built in task. protected override void ConfigureTargets ( ITaskContext context ) { context .

You can apply specific condition when retry mechanism will retry task. .Finally(c => { c.LogInfo(\"Example\");})) - Finally block acts just like finally in try catch. .DoNotFailOnError() - script does not fail in case of exception. You can apply specific condition when task will not fail. .NoLog() - Task doesn't log anything to console output. .SetDescription() - Overrides the default help description of the task. .ForMember() - pass through console argument to method or property.

Configuration ( \"Debug\" ); })); .Interactive() - Interactively pass argument from console to specified task method / parameter. Task attributes (Versioning) \u00b6 It is possible to execute some tasks with attribute on property Flubu will inject return value of the task to the property. This is especially usefull for all versioning tasks, basically all tasks that return a value. See FlubuCore.Tasks.Attributes namespace for all available attributes. [FetchBuildVersionFromFile] public BuildVersion BuildVersion { get ; } [GitVersion] public GitVersion GitVersion { get ; } This allows you to access version information in ConfigureTarget which is not possible if versioning task is executed for example as target dependency protected override void ConfigureTargets ( ITaskContext context ) { context . CreateTarget ( \"Build\" ) . AddCoreTask ( x => x . Build (). Version ( BuildVersion . Version . ToString ())); } Write custom c# code (custom tasks) \u00b6 Following example executes custom code. You can also use built in flubu tasks in custom code as shown in example. protected override void ConfigureTargets ( ITaskContext context ) { context . CreateTarget ( \"Example\" ) . Do ( CustomCodeExample ); } private static void CustomCodeExample ( ITaskContext context ) { //// You can put any c# code here and use any .net libraries. Console .

Do ( CustomCodeExample , \"some value\" , 1 ); } private static void CustomCodeExample ( ITaskContext context , string arg1 , int arg2 ) { Console . WriteLine ( \"Dummy custom code\" ); context . Tasks (). NUnitTaskForNunitV3 ( \"project name\" ). Execute ( context ); } Target dependencies \u00b6 Target can have dependencies on other targets. All dependenies will be executed before target in the specified order. When targetC is executed target\u2019s will execute in the following order: TargetB, TargetA, TargetC var targetA = context . CreateTarget ( \"TargetA\" ); var targetB = context . CreateTarget ( \"TargetB\" ); var targetC = context . CreateTarget ( \"TargetC\" ). DependsOn ( targetB , targetA ); It is also possible to reverse dependency var targetC = context . CreateTarget ( \"TargetC\" ). DependenceOf ( targetA ); Add target to target \u00b6 Target can be executed within other target with AddTarget. Target is executed in the order it was added Example: protected override void ConfigureTargets ( ITaskContext context ) { var exampleB = context . CreateTarget ( \"TargetB\" ) . Do ( Something ); context . CreateTarget ( \"TargetA\" ) . AddCoreTask ( x => x . Build ()) . AddTarget ( exampleB ) . Do ( JustAnExample ); } public void JustAnExample ( ITaskContext context ) { ... } following execution order is taken when TargetA is executed Build task TargetB target JustAnExample method Reuse set of tasks in different targets \u00b6 Following example shows how to reuse set of tasks in different targets: protected override void ConfigureTargets ( ITaskContext session ) { session . CreateTarget ( \"deploy.local\" ). AddTasks ( Deploy , \"c:\\\\ExamplaApp\" ). SetAsDefault (); session . CreateTarget ( \"deploy.test\" ). AddTasks ( Deploy , \"d:\\\\ExamplaApp\" ); session .

ControlAppPoolTask ( \"Example app pool\" , ControlApplicationPoolAction . Stop ). DoNotFailOnError ()) . Do ( UnzipPackage ) . AddTask ( x => x . CopyDirectoryStructureTask ( @\"Packages\\ExampleApp\" , @\"C:\\ExampleApp\" , true ). Retry ( 20 , 5000 )) . Do ( CreateWebSite ) } Add tasks to target with a foreach loop \u00b6 Following example shows how to add multiple tasks to target with a foreach loop protected override void ConfigureTargets ( ITaskContext context ) { var solution = context . GetVsSolution (); context . CreateTarget ( \"Pack\" ) . ForEach ( solution . Projects , ( item , target ) => { target . AddCoreTask ( x => x . Pack (). Project ( item . ProjectName )) . Do ( JustAnExample , item ); }); } private void JustAnExample ( ITaskContext context , VSProjectInfo vsProjectInfo ) { //// Do something. } Example will execute Pack task for each project in solution. Group tasks and apply When, OnError, Finally on them \u00b6 Conditonal task execution with When clause on group of tasks. protected override void ConfigureTargets ( ITaskContext context ) { context . CreateTarget ( \"Example\" ) . AddCoreTask ( x => x . Build ()) . Group ( target => { target . AddCoreTask ( x => x . Pack ()); target . AddCoreTask ( x => x . NugetPush ( \"pathToPackage\" )); }, when : c => ! c . BuildSystems (). Jenkins (). IsRunningOnJenkins ); } Finally on group of tasks: onFinally acts just like finally in try/catch. context . CreateTarget ( \"Example\" ) . AddCoreTask ( x => x . Build ()) . Group ( target => { target . AddCoreTask ( x => x . Pack ()); target . AddCoreTask ( x => x . NugetPush ( \"pathToPackage\" )); }, onFinally : c => { c . Tasks (). DeleteFilesTask ( \"pathToNupkg\" , \"*.*\" , true ). Execute ( c ); }); OnError on group of tasks: You can perform some custom action when error occures in any of tasks that are in group. context . CreateTarget ( \"Example\" ) . AddCoreTask ( x => x . Build ()) . Group ( target => { target . AddCoreTask ( x => x . Pack ()); target . AddCoreTask ( x => x . NugetPush ( \"pathToPackage\" )); }, onError : ( c , error ) => { //// some custom action when error occures in any of the task in group. }); Asynchronus or parallel execution of tasks, customCode and dependencies \u00b6 Tasks can be executed asynchrounously or in parallel with AddTaskAsync or AddCoreTaskAsync method. Custom code can be executed asynchrounosly with DoAsync method. Dependencies can be executed asynchrounosly with DependsOnAsync method. Following target executes 3 tasks in parallel. session . CreateTarget ( \"run.tests\" ) . AddTaskAsync ( x => x . NUnitTaskForNunitV3 ( \"TestProjectName1\" )) . AddTaskAsync ( x => x . NUnitTaskForNunitV3 ( \"TestProjectName1\" )) . AddTaskAsync ( x => x . NUnitTaskForNunitV3 ( \"TestProjectName3\" )); Async and sync methods can also be mixed session . CreateTarget ( \"async.example\" ) . AddTaskAsync ( x => x . NUnitTaskForNunitV3 ( \"TestProjectName1\" )) . AddTaskAsync ( x => x . NUnitTaskForNunitV3 ( \"TestProjectName1\" )) . Do ( SomeCustomMethod ) . DoAsync ( SomeCustomAsyncMethod2 ) . DoAsync ( SomeCustomAsyncMethod3 ); The code above will first execute 2 nunit tasks asynchronously and wait for both tasks to finish. Then it will execute SomeCustomMethod synchrounosly. After it is finished code from SomeCustomAsyncMethod2 and SomeCustomAsyncMethod3 will be executed in parallel. sequential logging in asynchronus executed tasks and targets \u00b6 Usually logs are not readable when executing more than 1 task asynchronously or in parallel. That's why FlubuCore offers sequential logging in asynchronus tasks. You can enable them with .SequentialLogging(true) on target. It has to be placed before asynchronus tasks/target dependencies otherwise logs will not be sequential. context . CreateTarget ( \"Test\" ) . SetAsDefault () . SequentialLogging ( true ) . AddCoreTaskAsync ( x => x . Pack ()) . AddCoreTaskAsync ( x => x . Pack ()) . DependsOnAsync ( test2 , test3 ); Target executed in parallel with FlubuCore runner have sequential logging on by default. flubu target1 target2 --parallel Other features \u00b6 Target features \u00b6 SetAsDefault method: When applied to target that target is runned by default if no target is specified when running the script with runner. SetAsHidden method: When applied to target that target is not shown in help and it can only be run as other target dependency. Must method: Condition in must will have to be meet otherwise target execution will fail before any task get executed. Requires method: Parameter specified in required method must not be null otherwise target execution will fail before any task get executed. Context features \u00b6 Log: context.LogInfo(\"Some Text2\", ConsoleColor.Blue); GetVsSolution: Get's solution and it's projects information(such as full project path, target framework, runtimeidentifier..) context.GetVsSolution(); GetFiles: Get Files from specified directory with option to filter files with glob pattern context.GetFiles(OutputDirectory, \"*.nupkg\"); GetDirectories: Get Directories from specified directory with option to filter files with glob pattern context.GetFiles(OutputDirectory, \"*.nupkg\"); GetEnviromentVariable method: Get's the enviroment variable by name context.GetEnvironmentVariable(\"someVariable\"); Run any program or command in build script with RunProgramTask \u00b6 protected override void ConfigureTargets ( ITaskContext session ) { var runExternalProgramExample = session . CreateTarget ( \"run.libz\" ) . AddTask ( x => x . RunProgramTask ( @\"packages\\LibZ.Tool\\1.2.0\\tools\\libz.exe\" ) . WorkingFolder ( @\".\\src\" ) . WithArguments ( \"add\" ) . WithArguments ( \"--libz\" , \"Assemblies.libz\" )); } Linux Example: protected override void ConfigureTargets ( ITaskContext context ) { var runExternalProgramExample = context . CreateTarget ( \"systemctl.example\" ) AddTask ( x => x . RunProgramTask ( @\"systemctl\" ) . WithArguments ( \"start\" ) . WithArguments ( \"nginx.service\" )); } Build properties \u00b6 You can define various build properties with Attributes on properties or in ConfigureBuildProperties method (old way) to share them in different tasks and custom code. Following example shows how to share solution file name and configuration across various targets/tasks. [SolutionFileName] public string SolutionFileName { get ; set ; } = \"FlubuExample.sln\" ; [BuildConfiguration] public string BuildConfiguration { get ; set ; } = \"Release\" ; protected override void ConfigureTargets ( ITaskContext context ) { context . CreateTarget ( \"build\" ) . AddCoreTask ( x => x . Build ()); context . CreateTarget ( \"pack\" ) . AddCoreTask ( x => x . Pack ()); } Alternative: [BuildProperty(BuildProps.BuildConfiguration)] public string BuildConfiguration { get ; set ; } = \"Release\" ; If Solution file name and path would not be set through build property attributes you would have to set it in each task separately. like so: protected override void ConfigureTargets ( ITaskContext context ) { context . CreateTarget ( \"build\" ) . AddCoreTask ( x => x . Build () . Project ( \"FlubuExample.sln\" ) . Configuration ( \"Release\" )); context . CreateTarget ( \"pack\" ) . AddCoreTask ( x => x . Pack () . Project ( \"FlubuExample.sln\" ) . Configuration ( \"Release\" )); } Predefined build properties \u00b6 Some build properties are already defined. You can access them through interface: context.Properties.Get(PredefinedBuildProperties.OsPlatform); Available predefined build properties: OsPlatform PathToDotnetExecutable UserProfileFolder OutputDir ProductRootDir All of them can be overriden. Pass command line arguments, settings from json configuration file or environment variables to your build script properties. \u00b6 You can pass command line arguments, settings from json configuration file or environment variables to your build script properties by adding FromArg attribute to property. public class SimpleScript : DefaultBuildScript { [FromArg(\"sn\", \"If true app is deployed on second node. Otherwise not.\")] public bool deployOnSecondNode { get ; set ; } protected override void ConfigureTargets ( ITaskContext context ) { context . CreateTarget ( \"Deploy.Exapmle\" ) . AddTask ( x => x . FlubuWebApiTasks (). GetTokenTask ( \"user\" , \"pass\" ). SetWebApiBaseUrl ( \"noade1Url\" )) . AddTask ( x => x . FlubuWebApiTasks (). UploadPackageTask ( \"packageDir\" , \"*.zip\" )) . AddTask ( x => x . FlubuWebApiTasks (). ExecuteScriptTask ( \"Deploy\" , \"DeployScript.cs\" )) . Group ( target => { target . AddTask ( x => x . FlubuWebApiTasks (). GetTokenTask ( \"user\" , \"pass\" ). SetWebApiBaseUrl ( \"noade2Url\" )) . AddTask ( x => x . FlubuWebApiTasks (). UploadPackageTask ( \"packageDir\" , \"*.zip\" )) . AddTask ( x => x . FlubuWebApiTasks (). ExecuteScriptTask ( \"Deploy\" , \"DeployScript.cs\" )); }, when : c => deployOnSecondNode ); } } First parameter in FromArg attribute is the argument key. Second is the help description of the property shown in flubu runner. You actually don't need to put attribute on property. If u dont then the key is the same as property name and help is not shown for property in build script runner. Property types that are supported: string, boolean, int, long, decimal, double, DateTime. Passing command line argument to build script property. \u00b6 Dotnet flubu Deploy.Example -sn=true Passing setting from json configuration file to build script property \u00b6 Create file FlubuSettings.json where Flubu runner is located. Add argument key and value to file in json format. For above example json file would look like this: { \"sn\" : true , \"SomeOtherKey\" : \"SomeOtherValue\" } It's typical to have different configuration settings for different environments for example development, testing, and production. Just create different json files FlubuSettings.{Environment}.Json and set enviroment variable 'ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT' on desired machine You can also create json configuration file by machine name FlubuSettings.{MachineName}.Json . If MachineName in file matches the machine name Flubu will automatically read settings from that file. Passing enviroment variable to build script property \u00b6 You can also set script arguments through environment variables. environment variables must have prefix flubu_ For above example you would add environment variable from windows command line with the following command: set flubu_sn=true Pass console arguments, settings from json configuration file, environment variables with ForMember to tasks. \u00b6 There is an alternative more sophisticated way to pass console arguments, settings and environment variables to tasks protected override void ConfigureTargets ( ITaskContext context ) { context . CreateTarget ( \"compile\" ) . AddTask ( x => x . CompileSolutionTask () . ForMember ( y => y . SolutionFileName ( \"someSolution.sln\" ), \"solution\" , \"The solution to build.\" )); } First parameter is the method or property argument that will be passed through. values set in method parameters are default values if argument is not specified when running the build script. Second parameter is the argument key. Third optional parameter is help that will be displayed in detailed target help. If parameter is not set then default generated help will be displayed.

Easy access to tasks through fluent interface Context.AddTask() or Context.Tasks() Each Flubu built in task derives from base class task meaning each built in task have retry, OnError, Finally, When, Interactive and some others mechanisms Pass command line arguments, settings from json configuration file or environment variables to your Properties in script. Allows you to reuse set of tasks. See Sample flubu supports parallel / async execution of target's, target dependencies and tasks to each task that execute external program or command you can add custom arguments with .WithArguments() method or even decide not to use fluent interface (good example: https://github.com/azabluda/InfoCarrier.Core/blob/develop/BuildScript/BuildScript.cs ) Alternative target definitions with attributes Flubu web api allows you to execute scripts remotely (usefull for deployments but not limited to) Override existing options or add additional options to tasks through console. https://flubucore.dotnetcore.xyz/override-add-options/ Flubu have really nice interactive mode https://flubucore.dotnetcore.xyz/build-script-runner-interactive/ Flubu Supports .net 461+ and .net core 1.0 Should I call Execute method when executing flubu built in task? if you are adding task to target through AddTask method Flubu calls Execute method when executing that target so in this scenario you should not call Execute on the task context . CreateTarget ( \"Build\" ) . AddCoreTask ( x => x . build ()); In the sample above BuildTask is added to the target. When target is executed Flubu executes all tasks that were added to target by calling task Execute method. in this case it executes BuildTask context . CreateTarget ( \"LoginEcr\" ) . Do ( c => { c . Tasks () . RunProgram ( \"aws\" ) . WithArguments ( \"ecr\" , \"get-login\" , \"--region\" , \"eu-central-1\" , \"--no-include-email\" )) . Execute ( context ); } In this sample Do actually adds DoTask to the target. When target is executed Flubu executes DoTask . DoTask in above example invokes Anonymous method which was assigned to the Action delegate (first parameter in Do Method). Flubu can not execute by itself tasks in the anonymous method you have to call Execute() method manually. Can I get output of the program, process or command that I am executing with Flubu?

Mainly it is meant to automate deployment of .net or .net core applications from your build server to different environments but it can be used for any other FlubuCore script execution. Web Api supports: Executing flubu scripts on the server where web api is deployed. Uploading (deploy or any other) packages to the server where web api is deployed. Deleting packages from server where web api is deployed. Sending reports back to client. Uploading FlubuCore scripts to the server where web api is deployed. Automatic updates Manual target execution through FlubuCore web app(deployed together with web api) In this getting started tutorial we will: Deploy FlubuCore web api to the server.

There are few small differences between using FlubuCore.WebApi for deploying .net core applications and .net applications. All differences are written in this tutorial. Write build script that will upload deployment package of the example application to the server and execute deployment script that we wrote. Run deployment script through build script remotely. Requirements \u00b6 .net 462+ runtime or .net core runtime installed on the server. Depending on which build of FlubuCore.WebApi you plan to use. Web api deployment \u00b6 Get appropriate web api deploy package from https://github.com/flubu-core/flubu.core/releases . Copy web api deployment package to the server where you want to execute flubu script. Unzip the package. Set web api deployment configuration settings in the unzipped DeploymentConfig.json file. More about specific deployment config settings can be found in the configuration file. On windows server run deploy.bat to deploy the web api On linux/mac server run: dotnet restore and after that: dotnet flubu -s=deploymentscript.cs On deployed location run dotnet FlubuCore.WebApi.dll to selfhost web api. You can of course also host it for example on iis... IIS deployment \u00b6 How to deploy asp .net core application see: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/publishing/iis?tabs=aspnetcore2x Some actions might need administration rights like starting / stoping the application pool. If that's the case u have to change identity on the application pool where you hosted the web api. Go to Application pools -> Web api app pool -> Advanced settings -> process model -> Identity and change to user which has admin rights. Write deploy script \u00b6 Example .net deploy script can be found Here . If u want to try the example the best way is to just clone the flubu core examples directory. Deploy script for .net core application would be of course slightly different. Example deploy script for .net application will Create iis application pool if it doesnt exists Stop the application pool Unzip package from /packages directory(which will be uploaded to web api with build script) Copy unziped application to new folder where it is/will be hosted. Create web site on iis for example web application Start the application pool When you finish writing your deploy script manually copy it to web api deployed location /scripts folder. Web api can also upload scripts but it is disabled by default for obvious security reason. It should stay disabled in most cases. If needed modify Example DeployScript for your needs. Write build script \u00b6 Example .net build script can be found here Example .net build script will Get the authentication token Delete old packages from /packages folder on web api. Upload package to web api /packages folder Execute Deployment script in /scripts folder that we manually uploaded If needed modify Example BuildScript for your needs. Run deploy script \u00b6 If u cloned example repository just execute at the root foolder: dotnet restore buildscript.csproj and dotnet flubu deploy -s=buildscript\\buildscript.cs in cmd from DeployScriptExample folder In real case scenario you would probably deploy from your build server after sucesfull build, after merge to release branch, manually execute the job on build server... Security \u00b6 As attacker can do alot of damage if he gains access to web api next security measures should be implemented if possible: If possible Flubu web api should not be publicly accessible. Always host web api on https. Restrict access by ip(config). Restrict access by time frame(config). This security measure should be taken if you deploy your application always at same time e.g 11pm. Then time frame when api can be accessed should be set for example from 11pm to 11.15pm, Use very strong password(web api user creation). Do not disable feature \"Restrict access on failed login\"(config). Enable email notifications when GetToken/Script is executed on api(config). For detailed description of security settings see appsettings.json file on web api. Automatic update \u00b6 You can automatically update FlubuCore web api if new version is available.

Then time frame when api can be accessed should be set for example from 11pm to 11.15pm, Use very strong password(web api user creation).
